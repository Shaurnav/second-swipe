# second-swipe

Craigslist for fashion reimagined in a TikTok UX 

An app where users can post TikTok-style videos showcasing outfits they want to sell. Users can swipe through their video feed (which we curate using an AI recommender algorithm), tap on clothes they want to buy, and set up an exchange.

With a revolutionary price estimation tool, a video verification app, alongside a innovative user-friendly platform for selling used items, we have created an environmentally sustainable way to resell your items!
